# Week 6B Starter Code

This is the starter code for the Week 6B in-class demo (Forms, Validation, Checkboxes & ListView).

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new Flutter project in VS Code (use the empty application template)
2. Replace the contents of `lib/main.dart` with the `main.dart` file from this repo
3. Run `flutter pub add email_validator` in your terminal
4. Run the app on your emulator

## What's Included

The starter code has:
- Basic app structure with StatefulWidget already set up
- Checkbox boolean variables (nullable `bool?` - we'll discuss why)
- Typed inventory list (`List<Map<String, dynamic>>`) for ListView demos
- Comments marking where we'll add code together

## In Class

We'll be:
- Building a Form with GlobalKey for validation
- Adding TextFormField with validator functions
- Using the email_validator package
- Working with Checkbox and CheckboxListTile
- Creating ListView (vertical and horizontal)
- Building dynamic lists with ListView.builder

## Participation Credit

To get GitHub Classroom participation credit, you can either:
- Commit just your updated `main.dart` file, OR
- Add your entire Flutter project folder

Both options work!
